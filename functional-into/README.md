Intro quick bio 

purpose of talk 

What is FP? quick mention of that it has benefits in some cases

quotes on FP
 - banana, gorilla, and the entire jungle
 - eric elliot - if you're creating ctor functions and calling new on them, you don't know javascript

Motivation:
 - Why OO sometimes sucks
 - fewer race cond / state mismatches
- simpler code, less code?
 - concurrent code

Why people sometimes say state is evil

Definitions
-----------

First class function
 - def / example / what is solves
 
Pure function

Referential transparency

Immutability (and why)

Higher order function

Compare OO vs FP
 - list iteration
 - memoization
 - currying  / partial function applition
 def. show mutating object state vs calling function and getting new object with changed state

Really simple example of an OO vs FP approach to a simple problem (fizz buzz or whatever ... Need to think of a good example)

more exmamples
--------------

partial function application

Downsides to FP
 - TBD
