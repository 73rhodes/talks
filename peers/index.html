- People want to be valued.
- When expectations are clear, people will usually try to meet and exceed them.

<section data-markdown data-background-gradient="linear-gradient(to bottom, #283b95, #17b2c3)" >
When expectations aren't met
 - expectations were not clear
 - they didn't have the right support or tools
 - they didn't have the opportunity to demonstrate value
   (the other side of accountability)
